        <p>
          As an artist I make pottery, work in graphic design and work as a videographer and editor. I have previous experience in software and am excited to add web development to my portfolio. Having learned about design, color and composition in school, I am excited to apply these skills to web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am looking forward to working with other developers and create websites for future clients!
