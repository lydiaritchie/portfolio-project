          As an artist I make pottery, work in graphic design and work as a videographer and editor. I have previous experience in software and am excited to add web development to my portfolio. Having learned about design, color and composition in school, I am excited to apply these skills to web development.

          I am looking forward to working with other developers and create websties for future clients!
